# dir655-sessions-reader
D-Link DIR-655 wifi router open sessions reader

Connects to DIR-655's web UI at 192.168.0.1 with empty password, loads a list of open sessions, prints them out.

I made this after experiencing this router slowing down randomly, and finding that some nice people were DDOSsing it with a lot of open connections.

The router is of course very old, this is just some old code from 2017.
